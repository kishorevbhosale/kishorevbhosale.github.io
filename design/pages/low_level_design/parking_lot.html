    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Designing a Parking Lot System</h2>
    <hr>

    <h5>Requirements:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>R1:</strong> The parking lot must accommodate up to 5,000 vehicles.</li>
        <li><strong>R2:</strong> There are four types of parking spots: handicapped, compact, large, and motorcycle.</li>
        <li><strong>R3:</strong> The parking lot should have multiple entry and exit points.</li>
        <li><strong>R4:</strong> Four types of vehicles are allowed: car, truck, van, and motorcycle.</li>
        <li><strong>R5:</strong> A display board should show available spots for each parking spot type.</li>
        <li><strong>R6:</strong> The system should prevent additional vehicles from entering if the lot reaches its 5,000 vehicle capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>R7:</strong> If the lot is full, the entrance and display board should show a "full" message.</li>
        <li><strong>R8:</strong> Customers should receive a parking ticket at the entrance and pay at the exit.</li>
        <li><strong>R9:</strong> Payments can be made at an automated exit panel or to a parking agent.</li>
        <li><strong>R10:</strong> Charges should be based on an hourly rate.</li>
        <li><strong>R11:</strong> Payments can be made by credit/debit card or cash.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Components:</h5>
    <p>
        The parking lot system can be divided into various components:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ParkingSpot:</strong> Represents individual parking spaces of various types (handicapped, compact, large, motorcycle).</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle:</strong> Represents different vehicle types (car, truck, van, motorcycle).</li>
            <li><strong>ParkingTicket:</strong> Represents the ticket issued to the customer, including the time of entry and payment details.</li>
            <li><strong>ParkingLot:</strong> The main system that handles parking spot allocation, vehicle tracking, entry, exit, and payment.</li>
            <li><strong>PaymentSystem:</strong> Handles payment and billing operations, including credit/debit payments and cash.</li>
            <li><strong>DisplayBoard:</strong> Displays available parking spots and full status of the parking lot.</li>
        </ul>

    <h5>Design Explanation:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vehicle:</strong> Represents a vehicle, either a car, truck, van, or motorcycle.</li>
        <li><strong>ParkingSpot:</strong> Represents a parking spot, with a specific type (e.g., handicapped, compact, large, motorcycle). It can be occupied or vacant.</li>
        <li><strong>ParkingTicket:</strong> Issued when a vehicle parks. Contains entry time, exit time, and parking fee calculation based on duration.</li>
        <li><strong>ParkingLot:</strong> Manages the parking spots and parking tickets. It checks if the parking lot is full and assigns spots based on vehicle type.</li>
        <li><strong>DisplayBoard:</strong> Updates the parking availability and shows if the parking lot is full.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h5>Design Considerations:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The system is designed to handle up to 5,000 vehicles and multiple spot types.</li>
        <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> New vehicle types or parking spot types can be added easily by modifying enums and the logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment:</strong> The payment system can be extended to handle different payment methods.</li>
    </ul>
