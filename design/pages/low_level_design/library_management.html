    <h5 id="Requirements">Requirements:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The library management system should allow librarians to manage books, members, and borrowing activities.</li>
        <li>The system should support adding, updating, and removing books from the library catalog.</li>
        <li>Each book should have details such as title, author, ISBN, publication year, and availability status.</li>
        <li>The system should allow members to borrow and return books.</li>
        <li>Each member should have details such as name, member ID, contact information, and borrowing history.</li>

        // Returning books
        library.returnBook("M001", "12345");  // Alice returns Java Programming
    }
}

<h5>Sample Input:</h5>
    <pre>
    // Adding books to the library
    Book book1 = new Book("Java Programming", "Author A", "12345", 2020);
    Book book2 = new Book("Data Structures", "Author B", "67890", 2018);
    library.addBook(book1);
    library.addBook(book2);

    // Adding members
    Member member1 = new Member("Alice", "M001", "alice@email.com");
    Member member2 = new Member("Bob", "M002", "bob@email.com");
    library.addMember(member1);
    library.addMember(member2);

    // Borrow books
    library.borrowBook("M001", "12345");  // Alice borrows Java Programming
    library.borrowBook("M002", "67890");  // Bob borrows Data Structures

    // Returning books
    library.returnBook("M001", "12345");  // Alice returns Java Programming
    </pre>

    <h5>Sample Output:</h5>
    <pre>
    // Output after Alice borrows Java Programming
    Transaction: borrow | Book: Java Programming | Member: M001 | Date: <current date and time>

    // Output after Bob borrows Data Structures
    Transaction: borrow | Book: Data Structures | Member: M002 | Date: <current date and time>

    // Output after Alice returns Java Programming
    Transaction: return | Book: Java Programming | Member: M001 | Date: <current date and time>

    // If Bob tries to borrow another book while having already borrowed the maximum allowed books
    Transaction: borrow | Book: Data Structures | Member: M002 | Date: <current date and time>
    Book is already borrowed.

    <h5 id="Explanation">Explanation:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Book Class:</strong> Contains the details of each book such as title, author, ISBN, publication year, and availability status. Methods allow borrowing and returning the book.</li>
        <li><strong>Member Class:</strong> Stores details about the library member including name, member ID, and contact information. It tracks the list of books borrowed by the member and ensures that borrowing limits are enforced.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction Class:</strong> Represents each borrowing or returning event. It logs the transaction and includes details like book, member, transaction type (borrow or return), and date.</li>
        <li><strong>Library Class:</strong> Manages the book catalog and member records. It provides the functionality to add and remove books, register members, and handle borrow/return operations. A lock is used to handle concurrency and ensure thread safety when multiple threads access the library system.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h5 id="Considerations">Design Considerations:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> The library system uses a lock to ensure that access to critical sections (such as borrowing or returning books) is thread-safe. This helps in preventing race conditions when multiple users access the library concurrently.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcing Rules:</strong> The system enforces rules such as a maximum number of books a member can borrow and checks if the book is available before borrowing.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The system is designed to be extensible. For example, we can easily add new features like overdue fees, more detailed member history, or integrating with an external database to persist book and member records.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Basic error handling is provided for common issues like invalid member or book, and exceeding the borrowing limit. More advanced error handling could be added as needed.</li>
    </ul>
