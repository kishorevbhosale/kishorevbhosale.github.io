    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Designing a Library Management System</h2>
    <hr>

    <h5>Requirements:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The library management system should allow librarians to manage books, members, and borrowing activities.</li>
        <li>The system should support adding, updating, and removing books from the library catalog.</li>
        <li>Each book should have details such as title, author, ISBN, publication year, and availability status.</li>
        <li>The system should allow members to borrow and return books.</li>
        <li>Each member should have details such as name, member ID, contact information, and borrowing history.</li>
        <li>The system should enforce borrowing rules, such as a maximum number of books that can be borrowed at a time and loan duration.</li>
        <li>The system should handle concurrent access to the library catalog and member records.</li>
        <li>The system should be extensible to accommodate future enhancements and new features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>High-Level Design:</h5>
    <p>
        To design a Library Management System, we will create several classes to represent the systemâ€™s components, such as:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Book:</strong> Represents the books in the catalog.</li>
            <li><strong>Member:</strong> Represents library members and tracks their borrowing activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Library:</strong> Manages the books and members, facilitates borrowing and returning books, and enforces borrowing rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction:</strong> Tracks each borrowing or returning event.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h5>Class Design:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Book:</strong> Contains details of a book.</li>
        <li><strong>Member:</strong> Stores member information and their borrowing history.</li>
        <li><strong>Library:</strong> The main interface for performing operations like borrowing, returning, adding, and removing books.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction:</strong> Holds information about each borrowing or return activity.</li>
    </ul>

<h5>Sample Input:</h5>
    <pre><code>
    // Adding books to the library

    Book book2 = new Book("Data Structures", "Author B", "67890", 2018);

    <h5>Sample Output:</h5>
    <pre><code>
    // Output after Alice borrows Java Programming
    Transaction: borrow | Book: Java Programming | Member: M001 | Date: <current date and time>

    // Output after Bob borrows Data Structures

    // Output after Alice returns Java Programming
    Transaction: return | Book: Java Programming | Member: M001 | Date: <current date and time>

    // If Bob tries to borrow another book while having already borrowed the maximum allowed books
    Transaction: borrow | Book: Data Structures | Member: M002 | Date: <current date and time>
    Book is already borrowed.
    </code></pre>

    <h5>Explanation of the Code:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Book Class:</strong> Contains the details of each book such as title, author, ISBN, publication year, and availability status. Methods allow borrowing and returning the book.</li>
        <li><strong>Member Class:</strong> Stores details about the library member including name, member ID, and contact information. It tracks the list of books borrowed by the member and ensures that borrowing limits are enforced.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction Class:</strong> Represents each borrowing or returning event. It logs the transaction and includes details like book, member, transaction type (borrow or return), and date.</li>
        <li><strong>Library Class:</strong> Manages the book catalog and member records. It provides the functionality to add and remove books, register members, and handle borrow/return operations. A lock is used to handle concurrency and ensure thread safety when multiple threads access the library system.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h5>Design Considerations:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> The library system uses a lock to ensure that access to critical sections (such as borrowing or returning books) is thread-safe. This helps in preventing race conditions when multiple users access the library concurrently.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcing Rules:</strong> The system enforces rules such as a maximum number of books a member can borrow and checks if the book is available before borrowing.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The system is designed to be extensible. For example, we can easily add new features like overdue fees, more detailed member history, or integrating with an external database to persist book and member records.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Basic error handling is provided for common issues like invalid member or book, and exceeding the borrowing limit. More advanced error handling could be added as needed.</li>
    </ul>
