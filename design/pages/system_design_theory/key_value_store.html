    <h5>Introduction to key-value stores</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Key-Value Stores work like distributed hash tables (DHTs) where each key, generated by a hash function, is unique and links to a value.</li>
        <li>The value can be anything like text, an image, or a server name, with no predefined structure.</li>
        <li>Large data can be stored in blob storage, and the key-value store holds links to that data.</li>
        <li>These stores are ideal for applications like user sessions, shopping carts, and product catalogs, as they scale better than traditional databases.</li>
        <li>Companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix use key-value stores for fast, reliable access to data in distributed systems.</li>
