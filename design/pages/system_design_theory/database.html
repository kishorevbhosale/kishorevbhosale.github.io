                However, this approach has significant limitations:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Concurrency: </b>Managing multiple users accessing the same file from different locations can lead to data corruption.</li>
                    <li><b>Access Control: </b>It's difficult to enforce different access rights for different users.</li>
                    <li><b>Scalability: </b>As the number of entries grows, performance declines, making it hard to scale.</li>
                    <li><b>Search Efficiency: </b>Retrieving specific user data becomes slow and inefficient as the file size increases.</li>
                </ul>
                These limitations make databases a better choice for applications that require reliable, scalable, and efficient data management.
            </p>
            <h5>There are two basic types of databases:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL (relational databases)</li>
                    <li>NoSQL (non-relational databases)</li>
                </ul>
            <br>

            <h3 class="section-title">What is a Relational Database?</h3>
            <p>A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables (relations) which can be linked—or related—based on common data attributes. Each table consists of rows (records) and columns (attributes), and relationships between tables are established using keys.</p>
                <hr>
                <h5>Why Relational Databases?</h5>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Structured Data:</strong> Data is organized into tables with predefined schemas, making it easy to understand and manage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Relationships between tables ensure data accuracy and reduce redundancy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Querying:</strong> SQL (Structured Query Language) is used for complex queries, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
            
                <h5>ACID Properties</h5>
                
                <p>Relational databases ensure data reliability through the ACID properties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Atomicity:</strong> Transactions are all-or-nothing; if one part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Transactions bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database rules and constraints.</li>
                    <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, ensuring data integrity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Once a transaction is committed, it remains permanent, even in case of system failures.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>    
            
                <h5>Examples</h5>
                <div class="example">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> A popular open-source relational database used for web applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> An open-source database known for its advanced features and standards compliance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oracle Database:</strong> A commercial database offering robust features for enterprise environments.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Drawbacks</h5>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scalability Issues:</strong> Relational databases can struggle with very large datasets or high transaction volumes, often requiring complex scaling solutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex Queries:</strong> Handling complex queries across multiple tables can be resource-intensive and impact performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Schema Rigidity:</strong> Changes to the database schema (structure) can be challenging and disruptive.</li>

            <h3 class="section-title">What is a Non-Relational Database?</h3>
                <p>A non-relational database, often referred to as NoSQL (Not Only SQL), is a type of database that stores and manages data in formats other than the traditional tabular structure used in relational databases. Non-relational databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, or rapidly changing data, providing more flexibility and scalability compared to traditional relational databases.</p>
                <hr>
                <h5>Key Characteristics of Non-Relational Databases:</h5>
                
                    <ul>    
                            <li><strong>Flexible Schema:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Non-relational databases do not require a fixed schema, meaning data structures can be modified without downtime or complex migrations.</li>
                                    <li>This flexibility allows for the storage of data in various formats, such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                        <li><strong>Data Models:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Document Stores:</strong> Store data as JSON, BSON, or XML documents. Each document can have a unique structure.
                                    <br><em>Example:</em> MongoDB, CouchDB.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key-Value Stores:</strong> Data is stored as a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and used to retrieve its corresponding value.
                                    <br><em>Example:</em> Redis, DynamoDB.</li>
                                <li><strong>Column-Family Stores:</strong> Data is stored in columns rather than rows, allowing for efficient retrieval of large datasets.
                                    <br><em>Example:</em> Cassandra, HBase.</li>
                                <li><strong>Graph Databases:</strong> Data is stored in nodes and edges, representing entities and their relationships, respectively.
                                    <br><em>Example:</em> Neo4j, ArangoDB.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Horizontal Scalability:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Non-relational databases are designed to scale out horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers or nodes.</li>
                                <li>This is particularly useful for applications that require handling massive amounts of data or high traffic, as additional nodes can be added to the cluster to manage the load.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <li>Non-relational databases often prioritize performance and availability, making them suitable for real-time applications.</li>
                                <li>Many NoSQL databases offer features like replication and sharding to ensure data is highly available and resilient to failures.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Handling Unstructured Data:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>These databases excel in managing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as logs, social media posts, IoT data, or multimedia files, which do not fit neatly into a relational table.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

            <h5>Drawbacks of Non-Relational Databases:</h5>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of ACID Compliance:</strong> Many NoSQL databases sacrifice ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for performance and scalability, which might not be suitable for all applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> The flexibility and scalability of non-relational databases can add complexity in terms of data modeling, consistency management, and query optimization.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Querying Capabilities:</strong> Non-relational databases often lack the sophisticated querying capabilities of SQL, making complex queries more challenging to perform.</li>
                <li><strong>Eventual Consistency:</strong> In distributed systems, non-relational databases may offer eventual consistency, meaning that data might not be immediately consistent across all nodes after an update.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <br>
        <h3 class="section-title">Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes</h3>

        <p>Indexes in relational databases improve the speed of data retrieval. The two most common types of indexes are <strong>Clustered Indexes</strong> and <strong>Non-Clustered Indexes</strong>. Let's explore the differences between them with examples.</p>

        <h5>1. Clustered Index in Relational Database</h5>
            <p>A <strong>Clustered Index</strong> sorts and stores the data rows of the table based on the indexed column(s). Since the data is physically sorted in the order of the index, each table can only have one clustered index.</p>
    
            <div class="example">
            <pre><code>
                CREATE TABLE Employees (
                EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
                Name VARCHAR(100),
                Department VARCHAR(50)
                );
            
    
                -- Creating a Clustered Index on the EmployeeID column (usually created by default for PRIMARY KEY)
                CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_EmployeeID ON Employees (EmployeeID);
            </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>In this case, the table's data rows will be sorted by the <b><em>EmployeeID</em></b>, and the index itself holds the data. The data is physically reordered to match the index.</p>
            <hr>
            <h5>2. Clustered Index in Non-Relational Database</h5>

                <p>A <strong>clustered index</strong> determines the physical order of the data in the database. In a clustered index, the data is stored directly within the index structure. This type of index ensures that records are physically ordered based on the indexed field, which improves the performance of range queries.</p>

                <div class="example">
                    In MongoDB, the <b><em>_id</em></b> field is automatically indexed as a clustered index. This ensures that documents are stored in the order of their <b><em>_id</em></b> values. When querying based on <b><em>_id</em></b>, MongoDB can quickly locate and retrieve the relevant document due to the sorted nature of the index.
                </div>
            <hr>
        <h5>3. Non-Clustered Index in Relational Database</h5>
            <p>A <strong>Non-Clustered Index</strong> does not affect the physical ordering of the data in the table. Instead, it creates a separate structure that holds the index and includes a pointer (reference) to the data rows. You can create multiple non-clustered indexes on a table.</p>
            
            <div class="example">
            <pre><code>
                -- Creating a Non-Clustered Index on the Name column
                CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_Name ON Employees (Name);
            </code></pre>
            </div>
            <hr>

            <h5>4. Non-Clustered Index in Relational Database</h2>

                <p>A <strong>non-clustered index</strong> is separate from the actual data storage. It contains a sorted list of key values along with pointers (references) to the actual data. The data itself is not stored in any specific order, but the index helps in quickly locating the data associated with the indexed field.</p>

                <div class="example">
                    In MongoDB, you can create a non-clustered index on any field. For instance, if you create an index on the <b><em>username</em></b> field in a collection, the index stores sorted <b><em>username</em></b> values and pointers to the respective documents. This improves search performance on the <b><em>username</em></b> field without affecting the document's physical storage order.
                </div>
            
            <p>In this example, the <b><em>Name</em></b> column is indexed in a separate structure. The actual data is still stored in the order of the clustered index (or the order in which it was inserted), but this index helps with faster lookups based on the <b><em>Name</em></b>.</p>
            <hr>
            <h5>Comparison of Clustered vs. Non-Clustered Index</h5>
