            <h3 class="section-title">TCP Protocol Overview</h3>
                <p>TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, is indeed a fundamental protocol for many networked applications, including distributed systems and HTTP. 
                    It operates at the transport layer of the Internet Protocol Suite and is known for its reliability and robustness. 
                </p>

                <p>TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before data transmission begins. 
                    This connection ensures that data is sent and received reliably, in the correct order, and without errors. 
                </p>
                    <h6>Reliable:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TCP ensures that data sent from the sender is reliably received by the receiver. It uses a mechanism known as acknowledgments and retransmissions to achieve this.</li>
                        <div class="example"> 
                            Suppose you’re sending a large file over a TCP connection. TCP will break this file into smaller packets. As each packet is received, the receiver sends an acknowledgment (<b>ACK</b>) back to the sender. 
                            If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment within a certain time frame, it will assume the packet was lost or corrupted and will resend it. This process continues until all packets are successfully acknowledged.
                            </div>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h6>Ordered:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TCP guarantees that packets arrive in the same order they were sent. This is crucial for applications where the sequence of data is important.</li>
                        <div class="example">
                            Consider a scenario where you are streaming a video. The video data is divided into packets and sent over the network. TCP ensures that these packets are reassembled in the correct order on the receiver’s end. 
                            If some packets are lost or arrive out of order, TCP will reorder them and request retransmission of any missing packets, ensuring the video plays correctly and smoothly.
                        </div>
                    </ul>
                                       
                    <h6>Error-Checked:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each TCP packet includes a checksum that is used to verify the integrity of the data. When a packet arrives at its destination, the receiver calculates the checksum and compares it to the one sent with the packet. If there is a mismatch, it indicates that the packet was corrupted, and the receiver will request a retransmission.</li>
                        <div class="example">
                            When sending a text message over TCP, the message is divided into packets, and each packet includes a checksum. If the receiver detects that the checksum doesn’t match the data (indicating potential corruption), it will ask the sender to resend that packet, ensuring the message is received correctly.
                        </div>
                    </ul>
   
            <br>


            <h3 class="section-title">UDP Protocol Overview</h3>
            <p>UDP, or User Datagram Protocol, is a lightweight and faster alternative to TCP. Unlike TCP, UDP is connectionless, which means it doesn’t establish a formal connection between sender and receiver before transmitting data. Let’s explore some of the characteristics of UDP based on the points you've provided:</p>
        
            <h6></h6>
            <ul>
                <li><b>No Acknowledgment (No ACK): </b>Unlike TCP, UDP does not use acknowledgments. Once the data is sent, there’s no confirmation from the receiver that the packet has arrived. The sender simply continues transmitting without waiting for feedback.</li>
                <li><b>No Ordering or Corruption Checking: </b>UDP does not guarantee that packets will arrive in order or even intact. If packets are dropped, arrive out of sequence, or get corrupted during transit, UDP does not attempt to correct these issues. It’s up to the application to handle this if necessary.</li>
                <li><b>Fast: </b>UDP’s lack of features like acknowledgment and retransmission makes it much faster than TCP. Since there’s no overhead for ensuring reliable delivery or ordering, data can be sent more quickly.</li>
                <li><b>Unreliable: </b>UDP is considered unreliable because it doesn’t check whether the data has arrived or whether it’s arrived in the correct order. Data loss is possible, and there are no guarantees of delivery.</li>
                <li><b>Faster Than TCP: </b>UDP is generally faster than TCP because it allows the sender to transmit large amounts of data quickly without waiting for acknowledgments or ensuring reliability. This is especially useful in applications where some data loss is acceptable for the sake of speed.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="example">
                <p>
                    In a stock exchange application, data needs to be sent quickly, even if some data packets are lost in transit. Similarly, for video streaming or online gaming, minor data losses may not significantly impact the user experience, so speed is prioritized over reliability.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h6>Common Use Cases</h6>
            <p>UDP is commonly used in scenarios where speed is critical, and a small amount of data loss is tolerable:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stock Exchanges:</strong> High-frequency trading requires real-time data delivery where speed is more important than reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Video Streaming:</strong> UDP allows for fast delivery of video packets, and minor losses or out-of-order packets can be handled by the application.</li>
                <li><strong>Online Gaming:</strong> In fast-paced multiplayer games, slight delays or packet loss can be tolerated for the sake of maintaining game speed and responsiveness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="section-title">What is HTTP/HTTPS?</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.</li>
                            <li>HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.</li>
                            <li>It is a stateless protocol, meaning each request from a client to server is independent, and the server does not retain user state between requests.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An extension of HTTP, where communication between the client and server is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security) or SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).</li>
                            <li>HTTPS ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged between the client and server.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTTP:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the server, typically requesting a resource like a web page.</li>
                            <li>The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which usually contains the requested resource (e.g., an HTML file, image, etc.).</li>
                            <li>HTTP operates over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), usually on port 80.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>HTTPS:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HTTPS follows the same process as HTTP, but before data is sent, the client and server establish a secure connection using SSL/TLS.</li>
                            <li>This secure connection ensures that the data exchanged is encrypted, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.</li>
                            <li>HTTPS typically operates over port 443.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>SSL is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client—typically 
                                a web server (website) and a browser or a mail server and a mail client (e.g., Outlook).</li>

                    <li><strong>Step 1: Client Hello</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The client initiates the handshake by sending a "Client Hello" message, which includes the SSL/TLS version it supports, 
                                the list of encryption algorithms, and a randomly generated number.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2: Server Hello</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The server responds with a "Server Hello" message, selecting the encryption algorithm from the list provided by the client 
                                and sending its SSL/TLS certificate. This certificate contains the server's public key.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3: Server Certificate and Key Exchange</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The server sends its SSL/TLS certificate, and if required, a "Server Key Exchange" message. 
                                The client verifies the certificate to ensure the server's authenticity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4: Client Key Exchange</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The client generates a "pre-master secret," encrypts it with the server's public key, and sends it to the server. 
                                Both client and server use this pre-master secret to generate the session keys used to encrypt the data.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 5: Finished Messages</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Both the client and server send a "Finished" message, encrypted with the session key, indicating that 
                                the handshake is complete and a secure session is established.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 6: Secure Communication</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All subsequent communication between the client and server is encrypted using the session keys established during the handshake.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
