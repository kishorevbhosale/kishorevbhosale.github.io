<h3 id="ct-overview">AWS CloudTrail Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A web service that records activity (API calls) made on your AWS account.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Enables governance, compliance, and operational/risk auditing of your AWS account.</li>
<li>Provides visibility into user activity by recording actions taken.</li>
<li>API history enables security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing.</li>
<li><strong>Records API calls made via:</strong>
<ul>
<li>AWS Management Console</li>
<li>AWS SDKs</li>
<li>AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</li>
<li>Higher-level AWS services (e.g., CloudFormation, EC2, S3).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Records details like:</strong> Identity of API caller, time of call, source IP, request parameters, response elements.</li>
<li><strong>Default State:</strong> CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create it. (<strong>Exam Tip!</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Event History:</strong> By default, CloudTrail records 90 days of management events in the CloudTrail Event History (viewable in console). A trail is needed for longer retention and S3 delivery.</li>
<li>CloudTrail is per AWS account and regional when you create a trail, but a single trail can apply to all regions.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="ct-trails">CloudTrail Trails</h3>
<ul>
<li>A configuration that delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Two types of trails:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trail that applies to all regions:</strong> Records events in all regions and delivers to a single S3 bucket. (Recommended for centralized logging).</li>
<li><strong>Trail that applies to a single region:</strong> Records events only in that specific region. Additional single-region trails can use the same or different S3 buckets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Event Selectors:</strong> Allow you to filter which events a trail logs (e.g., specific event names, read/write type, resources).</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="ct-event-types">Event Types (Management vs. Data)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trails can be configured to log Management Events and/or Data Events.</li>
<li><strong>Management Events (Control Plane Operations):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Provide insight into management operations performed on resources in your AWS account.</li>
<li>Examples: Configuring security (<code>IAM AttachRolePolicy</code>), registering devices (<code>EC2 CreateDefaultVpc</code>), configuring routing rules (<code>EC2 CreateSubnet</code>), setting up logging (<code>CloudTrail CreateTrail</code>).</li>
<li>Non-API events (e.g., console sign-in) can also be included.</li>
<li>Charged: Management events are typically free for a certain volume, then charged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Events (Data Plane Operations):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Provide insight into resource operations performed on or within a resource.</li>
<li>Examples: Amazon S3 object-level API activity (<code>GetObject</code>, <code>DeleteObject</code>, <code>PutObject</code>), AWS Lambda function execution activity (<code>Invoke</code> API).</li>
<li>Charged: Data events incur additional charges and are not logged by default. You must explicitly enable them. (<strong>Exam Tip!</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="ct-log-storage-encryption">Log File Storage & Encryption</h3>
<ul>
<li>CloudTrail log files are delivered to an Amazon S3 bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Default Encryption:</strong> Log files are encrypted at rest using S3 Server-Side Encryption (SSE-S3) by default.</li>
<li><strong>Optional Encryption:</strong> You can enable encryption using SSE-KMS for additional security (using your own KMS key).</li>
<li>A single KMS key can be used to encrypt log files for trails applied to all regions.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="ct-log-consolidation">Log Consolidation (Multiple Accounts)</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can consolidate logs from multiple AWS accounts into a single S3 bucket for centralized auditing.</li>
<li>Steps:
<ol>
<li>Turn on CloudTrail in the paying account.</li>
<li>Create an S3 bucket policy that allows cross-account access (write permissions from other accounts).</li>
<li>Turn on CloudTrail in the other accounts and configure them to use the S3 bucket in the paying account.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="ct-integration">Integration with CloudWatch Logs</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can integrate CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs to deliver captured events to a CloudWatch Logs log stream.</li>
<li>This enables:
<ul>
<li>Real-time monitoring: Create CloudWatch Alarms based on specific API calls or patterns in the logs.</li>
<li>Longer retention: Configure custom retention periods for logs in CloudWatch Logs.</li>
<li>Metrics: Create CloudWatch Metrics from log data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="ct-integrity">Log File Integrity Validation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Feature that allows you to determine whether a CloudTrail log file was unchanged, deleted, or modified since CloudTrail delivered it to S3.</li>
<li>Uses cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) and digital signing for validation.</li>
<li>Crucial for compliance and forensic analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ct-exam-tips">Important Exam Tips & Tricks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Who did what, when, where?"</strong> If a question asks about auditing, security analysis, compliance, or tracking changes made to your AWS environment, think CloudTrail.</li>
<li><strong>"How is my application performing?"</strong> If a question asks about performance, resource utilization, application health, or operational insights, think CloudWatch.</li>
<li>Default Behavior: CloudTrail is enabled by default for your account, but to get logs delivered to S3 for long-term storage and detailed analysis, you must create a trail. The console's Event History only shows 90 days.</li>
<li>Data Events vs. Management Events: Data events are not logged by default and cost more. You need to explicitly enable them for S3 object-level actions or Lambda invokes.</li>
<li>Encryption: Logs are SSE-S3 encrypted by default; SSE-KMS is an option.</li>
<li>Log Integrity: Remember the log file integrity validation feature for compliance.</li>
<li>Centralized Logging: Know the process for setting up cross-account CloudTrail logging to a central S3 bucket.</li>
<li>Real-time Alarms: To get real-time alerts from CloudTrail events, you must integrate CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs and then create CloudWatch Alarms on specific log patterns.</li>
</ul>
