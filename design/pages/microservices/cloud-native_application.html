    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Features of Cloud-Native Applications</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Cloud-native applications are software applications designed specifically to utilize cloud computing principles and technologies. These applications leverage the scalability, elasticity, and flexibility of cloud environments to deliver high performance and efficiency.</p>

    <h4>Layman Definition:</h4>
    <p>Cloud-native applications are built to take full advantage of the cloud's capabilities, ensuring they run effectively and efficiently in cloud-based environments.</p>

    <h4>Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Definition:</h4>
    <p>Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Utilizing containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs, these technologies enable resilient, manageable, and observable systems. With robust automation, they allow engineers to make impactful changes predictably and efficiently.</p>

    <h3>Key Characteristics of Cloud-Native Applications:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Microservices</b>:
            <p>Cloud-native applications are often built using a microservices architecture. The application is broken into smaller, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Containers</b>
            <p>These applications are typically packaged and deployed using containers (e.g., Docker). Containers provide a lightweight, consistent runtime environment, making applications highly portable across different cloud platforms.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Scalability & Elasticity</b>
            <p>Cloud-native applications are designed to scale horizontally, allowing them to handle increased loads by adding more service instances. With orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, they can automatically scale up or down based on demand.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>DevOps Practices</b>
            <p>Cloud-native applications embrace DevOps principles, fostering collaboration between development and operations teams. They use continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and automated deployment pipelines to streamline development and deployment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Resilience & Fault Tolerance</b>
            <p>These applications are designed to be resilient against failures. They employ techniques like distributed architecture, load balancing, and automated failure recovery to maintain high availability and fault tolerance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Cloud-Native Services</b>
            <p>Cloud-native applications leverage managed services provided by cloud platforms, such as databases, messaging queues, caching systems, and identity services. This allows developers to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure management.</p>
        </li>
