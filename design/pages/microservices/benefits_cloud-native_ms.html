    <h3>Challenges with Monolithic Architecture</h3>
    <p>Monolithic architecture refers to a single-tiered software application where all components are interconnected and interdependent. While this design works well for smaller applications, it creates several challenges for large-scale systems such as an e-commerce platform. Below are the key issues:</p>

    <h5>Problems Faced Due to Monolithic Design</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Lack of Scalability:</b> Scaling a monolithic application requires scaling the entire application, even if only a specific feature (e.g., search or payment processing) needs additional resources.</li>
        <li><b>Slow Development:</b> Since all components are tightly coupled, changes to one module require extensive testing and may inadvertently affect other parts of the system.</li>
        <li><b>Deployment Complexity:</b> Deploying updates or fixes involves redeploying the entire application, increasing downtime and the risk of deployment failures.</li>
        <li><b>Technology Lock-in:</b> Monolithic applications are typically built using a single tech stack, limiting the flexibility to adopt newer technologies for specific features.</li>
        <li><b>Fault Isolation:</b> A failure in one part of the application (e.g., a payment gateway outage) can bring down the entire system.</li>
        <li><b>Long Build and Deployment Times:</b> As the codebase grows, the build and deployment cycles become increasingly time-consuming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Characteristics of Monolithic Architecture</h3>
    <p>Monolithic architecture is characterized by the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A single codebase shared by all features and services.</li>
        <li>Tight coupling of modules, making it difficult to isolate and modify specific functionalities.</li>
        <li>Unified database, where all components interact with the same schema.</li>
        <li>Centralized deployment, requiring the entire application to be redeployed for any change.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <pre><code>
        // Example of tightly coupled e-commerce modules
        public class ECommerceApplication {
            private InventoryModule inventory;
            private PaymentModule payment;
            private OrderModule order;

            public void placeOrder() {
                inventory.checkStock();
                payment.processPayment();
                order.createOrder();
            }
        }
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Adopting Cloud-Native Design with Microservice Architecture</h3>
    <p>To overcome the challenges of monolithic architecture, an e-commerce application can be restructured using a cloud-native microservices design. This involves decomposing the monolith into smaller, loosely coupled services that are easier to develop, scale, and maintain.</p>

    <h5>Steps to Transition:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Identify Service Boundaries:</b>
            Analyze the monolithic application and break it into smaller services based on business domains (e.g., Inventory, Payment, Order, User Management).
            <h5>Example:</h5>
            <pre><code>
                Inventory Service: Manages product stock levels.
                Payment Service: Handles transactions and payments.
                Order Service: Manages order creation and tracking.
            </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Adopt API-Based Communication:</b>
            Replace internal method calls with RESTful APIs or messaging queues to allow services to communicate independently.
            <h5>Example:</h5>
            <pre><code>
                // RESTful API Example
                @RestController
                @RequestMapping("/inventory")
                public class InventoryController {
                    @GetMapping("/stock/{productId}")
                    public int getStock(@PathVariable Long productId) {
                        return inventoryService.checkStock(productId);
                    }
                }
            </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Decouple the Database:</b>
            Move from a single, centralized database to separate databases for each service to achieve data isolation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Leverage Cloud Infrastructure:</b>
            Use containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) to deploy and manage services in a scalable manner.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Implement Observability:</b>
            Integrate monitoring and logging tools to track service performance and quickly identify issues.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Advantages of Cloud-Native Microservices:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved scalability by allowing independent scaling of services.</li>
        <li>Faster development cycles with isolated deployments.</li>
        <li>Greater fault tolerance as service failures do not impact the entire application.</li>
        <li>Flexibility to adopt the best technology stack for each service.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Challenges of Microservices:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased complexity in managing multiple services.</li>
        <li>Higher operational overhead due to distributed nature.</li>
        <li>Potential latency issues due to inter-service communication.</li>
