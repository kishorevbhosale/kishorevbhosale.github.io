Here are the 12 factors that contribute to a successful microservices architecture, often referred to as the "12-Factor App" methodology:

Codebase: One codebase tracked in version control, with many deploys.
Dependencies: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
Config: Store configuration in the environment.
Backing Services: Treat backing services as attached resources.
Build, Release, Run: Strictly separate the build and run stages.
Processes: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.
Port Binding: Export services via port binding.
Concurrency: Scale out via the process model.
Disposability: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.
Dev/Prod Parity: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.
Logs: Treat logs as event streams.
Admin Processes: Run administrative/management tasks as one-off processes.
