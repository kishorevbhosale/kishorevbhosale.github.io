  <hr />
  <p>
    Spring Boot Actuator provides health indicators to monitor the state of the
    application. Among these indicators, two crucial ones are Liveness and
    Readiness checks, which help manage the application’s lifecycle in a
    cloud-native environment.
  </p>

  <h4>Liveness</h4>
  <p>
    Liveness probes are used to determine if an application is alive and
    responsive. The main purpose of a liveness check is to ensure that the
    application is still running and capable of accepting requests. If the
    liveness probe fails, Kubernetes or other orchestration platforms will
    consider the container unhealthy and may decide to restart it to recover
    from potential failures.
  </p>
  <pre>
# application.properties
management.health.liveness.enabled=true
management.health.liveness.database.enabled=true
management.health.liveness.database.jdbc-url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
</pre
  >
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> You can configure liveness probes to check a
    database connection or other health indicators to ensure the application is
    functional. The health endpoint for liveness would typically be accessed via
    <code>/actuator/health/liveness</code>.
  </p>
  <pre>
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/liveness
{
    "status": "UP",
    "details": {
        "database": {
            "status": "UP",
            "database": "mydb",
            "validationQuery": "SELECT 1"
        }
    }
}
</pre
  >

  <h4>Readiness</h4>
  <p>
    Readiness probes are used to determine if the application is fully
    initialized and ready to accept traffic. The readiness probe is especially
    crucial during the startup phase of the application or after a configuration
    change. If the readiness probe fails, the orchestrator can block traffic to
    the application, preventing users from encountering errors due to incomplete
    service startup.
  </p>
  <pre>
# application.properties
management.health.readiness.enabled=true
management.health.readiness.database.enabled=true
management.health.readiness.database.jdbc-url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
</pre
  >
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> Readiness checks are typically used to ensure all
    required services, dependencies, and configuration are ready before the
    application starts accepting traffic. The health endpoint for readiness
    would be accessed via <code>/actuator/health/readiness</code>.
  </p>
  <pre>
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/readiness
{
    "status": "UP",
    "details": {
        "database": {
            "status": "UP",
            "database": "mydb",
            "validationQuery": "SELECT 1"
        }
    }
}
</pre

  <h3>Key Differences:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Liveness:</strong> Indicates whether the application is
      operational and capable of accepting traffic. If the probe fails, the
      container is restarted.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Readiness:</strong> Checks if the application is fully initialized
      and ready to serve traffic. If the probe fails, traffic is blocked to the
      container.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Configuring Liveness and Readiness in Spring Boot</h3>
  <p>
    To configure these checks, you can use the
    <code>management.endpoints.web.exposure.include</code> property to expose
    the health endpoint, and the specific health indicators can be enabled using
    properties like <code>management.health.liveness.enabled</code> and
    <code>management.health.readiness.enabled</code>.
  </p>
  <pre>
# application.properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health
</pre
