    <h2 style="text-align: center;">15 Factors in Microservices</h2>
    <p>
        Microservices architecture involves breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, independent services, each with its own responsibilities and boundaries. 
        The 15 factors are principles that guide the design, implementation, and management of microservices, ensuring their effectiveness, scalability, and maintainability.

        <h3>1) Single Code Base</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining a single code base ensures that all microservices share the same set of code and libraries.</li>
                <li>Enables easier updates and bug fixes across all services simultaneously without diverging code bases.</li>
                <li>Helps in ensuring consistency in the applicationâ€™s functionality and reduces duplication of effort.</li>
                <li>Facilitates better collaboration among development teams as they work on the same code base.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>2) API First</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adopting an API-first approach means designing APIs before implementing the actual service logic.</li>
                <li>Ensures services are loosely coupled, with well-defined interfaces for communication between microservices.</li>
                <li>Promotes a more modular architecture where services are more independent.</li>
                <li>Allows for better flexibility in choosing technologies and easier integration with third-party systems.</li>
            </ul>

    <div class="factor">
        <h3>3) Dependency Management</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each microservice manages its dependencies independently, including external libraries and services.</li>
                <li>Reduces the risk of version conflicts across microservices.</li>
                <li>Dependencies are isolated to their respective microservice, which simplifies updates and reduces potential issues.</li>
                <li>Tools like Docker and package managers (e.g., Maven, npm) play a key role in managing these dependencies.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="factor">
        <h3>4) Design, Build and Deploy</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Microservices follow a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for design, build, and deploy processes.</li>
                <li>Each service is versioned independently and can be deployed independently.</li>
                <li>Automated testing and deployment ensure that any updates do not impact the entire system.</li>
                <li>Enables faster release cycles and easier scaling and updating of services without downtime.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Microservices need a mechanism for managing configuration and sensitive credentials independently.</li>
                <li>Spring Cloud Config and Vault are used to manage configurations and secrets securely across microservices.</li>
                <li>Environment-specific properties are loaded dynamically at runtime.</li>
                <li>Helps in isolating sensitive data and making changes without requiring a redeployment.</li>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Microservices are designed to be disposable, which means they can be started, stopped, and replaced easily.</li>
                <li>Facilitates better management of resources and allows scaling based on demand.</li>
                <li>Promotes fault tolerance by isolating failures to individual services.</li>

        <h3>8) Backing Services</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Microservices rely on external backing services like databases, caches, or messaging queues.</li>
                <li>These services are abstracted away from the microservices, allowing them to remain independent.</li>
                <li>Backing services are managed independently and can be scaled or updated without impacting the microservices.</li>
                <li>Enables flexibility and simplifies management, as services can be changed without affecting the application logic.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
<hr>
    <div class="factor">
        <h3>9) Environment Parity</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>All environments (development, testing, production) should be as similar as possible.</li>
                <li>Ensures that a service behaves the same in all environments, reducing surprises when moving to production.</li>
                <li>Environment parity is maintained by using tools like Docker, container orchestration (Kubernetes), and CI/CD pipelines.</li>
                <li>Helps in achieving consistent results and reducing the risk of environment-specific bugs.</li>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Microservices use dynamic port binding for communication.</li>
                <li>Each service binds to a different port, avoiding conflicts and ensuring that they can run independently.</li>
                <li>Communication is done through APIs, using REST or messaging protocols like AMQP.</li>
                <li>Allows for easy scaling and flexibility, as services can be moved across different servers or environments without conflicts.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
<hr>
    <div class="factor">
        <h3>12) Stateless Process</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each microservice is designed to be stateless, storing no client-specific data between requests.</li>
                <li>Data is managed outside of the service itself, often in backing services or external databases.</li>
                <li>Helps in scaling services horizontally, as instances of the microservice can be added or removed without impacting session state.</li>
                <li>Ensures fault tolerance and reduces complexity in managing state across the system.</li>

        <h3>15) Authentication and Authorization</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Security is crucial in microservices architecture, requiring robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Each service manages its own authentication, often using OAuth, JWT, or API keys.</li>
                <li>Authorization is managed by roles and permissions, ensuring that users and services can access only the resources they are entitled to.</li>
                <li>Tools like Spring Security and identity management systems (e.g., Okta, Auth0) are used for managing security across services.</li>
