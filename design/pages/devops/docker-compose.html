  <hr />
  <p>
    Docker Compose is a tool provided by Docker to define and manage
    multi-container applications. It uses a <strong>YAML</strong> file to
    describe the services, networks, and volumes required for your application.
    With Docker Compose, you can specify the configuration and relationships
    between different containers, simplifying the setup and management of
    complex application environments.
  </p>

  <h4>Key Features:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Defines multiple services in a single YAML file.</li>
    <li>Manages networks and volumes automatically.</li>
    <li>Orchestrates container startup and dependencies seamlessly.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Advantages of Docker Compose</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Single Command Execution:</strong> You can create and start all
      the containers defined in your Docker Compose file using a single command
      (<code>docker-compose up</code>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Orchestration:</strong> Docker Compose handles networking and
      ensures containers can communicate as defined in the configuration.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scaling:</strong> Easily scale services up or down by adjusting
      the configuration.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dependency Management:</strong> Ensures that dependent containers
      start in the correct order.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Simplified Application Lifecycle:</strong> Makes it easy to stop,
      start, and update your application.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why Not Use CLI for Multiple Containers?</h3>
  <p>
    Running multiple containers using the Docker CLI can become error-prone and
    cumbersome:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Manual execution of multiple commands increases the risk of errors.</li>
    <li>
      Commands written directly in the terminal are harder to maintain and lack
      clarity.
    </li>
    <li>
      Version control for CLI commands is challenging compared to using a
      structured YAML file.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How Docker Compose Works</h3>
  <p>
    Docker Compose uses a YAML file (<code>docker-compose.yml</code>) to define
    the services, networks, and volumes of an application. When you run the
    <code>docker-compose up</code> command:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Compose reads the YAML file and creates a network for the defined
      services.
    </li>
    <li>It builds or pulls container images as specified.</li>
    <li>
      Starts all services and ensures they are connected to the specified
      network.
    </li>
    <li>
      Maintains the lifecycle of the containers, making it easy to scale, stop,
      or restart services.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>docker-compose.yml</h3>
  <pre>
version: "3.8"  # Specifies the Docker Compose file format version
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest  # Specifies the image for the 'web' service
    ports:
      - "8080:80"        # Maps port 80 in the container to port 8080 on the host
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html  # Mounts local directory to the container's directory
    networks:
      - my-network        # Connects the service to 'my-network'

  app:
    build:
      context: .          # Uses the current directory to build the image
      dockerfile: Dockerfile  # Specifies the Dockerfile to use
    depends_on:
      - db               # Ensures the 'db' service starts before 'app'
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod  # Passes environment variables to the container
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"       # Maps port 8081 on the container to port 8081 on the host
    networks:
      - my-network        # Connects the service to 'my-network'

  db:
    image: postgres:13    # Specifies the image for the 'db' service
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data  # Creates a named volume for persistent storage
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: admin
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password  # Passes database credentials to the container
    networks:
      - my-network        # Connects the service to 'my-network'

networks:
  my-network:
    driver: bridge         # Creates a custom bridge network

volumes:
  db-data:                 # Defines a named volume for the database
