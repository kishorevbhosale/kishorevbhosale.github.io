    <hr>

    <h5>Functional Requirements</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Should support one-on-one chats</li>
        <li>Should support group chats</li>
        <li>Should have image, video and file-sharing capabilities</li>
        <li>Should indicate read/receipt of messages</li>
        <li>Show indicate last seen time of users</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h5>Non-Functional Requirements:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Should have very very low latency</li>
        <li>Should be always available</li>
        <li>There shouldn’t be any lags</li>
        <li>Should be highly scalable</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Estimation:</h5>
    <p>
        As of early 2025, WhatsApp reportedly handles 100 billion messages per day.This figure includes text messages, media, and voice/video calls.
    </p>
    <b>Storage Estimation:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average</li>
        <li>100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day</li>
        <li>For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:</li>
        <li>30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Number of server assumption:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Lets assume whatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.</li>
        <li>No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers</li>
        <li>So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> High level design:</h3>
    <img src="../../../images/whatsapp.png" alt="cache" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 80%;">
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Connection with a WebSocket server:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Each active WhatsApp device connects to a WebSocket server using the WebSocket protocol.</li>
            <li>WebSocket servers maintain open connections for all active (online) users.</li>
            <li>Multiple servers are deployed to handle billions of users since a single server cannot handle the entire load.</li>
            <li>Each server is responsible for providing a port to every online user.</li>
            <li>A WebSocket manager oversees the mapping of servers, ports, and users.</li>
            <li>The mapping data is stored and managed using a cluster of the data store, with Redis being used for this purpose</li>.
        </ul>
        
        <li><b>Send or receive messages:</b></li>
        <p>The system performs the following steps to send messages from user A to user B:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> User A sends a message via their connected WebSocket server.</li>
            <li>User A's WebSocket server queries the WebSocket manager to find the server connected to User B.</li>
            <li>If User B is online, the WebSocket manager provides the details of User B's WebSocket server to User A's WebSocket server.</li>
            <li>User A's WebSocket server sends the message to the message service, which stores it in a <b>MySQL database</b> for processing in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order.</li>
            <li>Messages are deleted from the <b>MySQL database</b> once delivered to the recipient.</li>
            <li>After identifying User B's WebSocket server, communication between User A and User B begins directly via their respective WebSocket servers.</li>
            <li>If User B is offline, messages are stored in the <b>MySQL database</b>.</li>
            <li>When User B comes online, messages are delivered via push notification or deleted permanently after 30 days.</li>
            <li>Both users communicate with the WebSocket manager to locate each other’s servers.</li>
            <li>Frequent conversations lead to caching optimizations by each WebSocket server, minimizing calls to the WebSocket manager.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Each WebSocket server caches recent conversation details, including user-to-server mappings.</li>
                <li>If users are connected to the same server, calls to the WebSocket manager are avoided.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Send or receive media files:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Media files are compressed and encrypted on the device side.</li>
            <li>The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service, which stores it on blob storage and assigns an ID to the file.</li>
            <li>The asset service maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication. If a file already exists in the blob storage, the same ID is reused instead of uploading the file again.</li>
            <li>The asset service sends the media file ID to the receiver via the message service.</li>
            <li>The receiver uses the ID to download the media file from the blob storage.</li>
            <li>Content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a high number of requests for specific content.</li>
        </ul>      
        <li><b>Support for group messages:</b></li>
        <div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>User A Sends a Message to the WebSocket Server:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>User A is connected to a WebSocket server, which maintains an active connection for the user.</li>
                  <li>When User A sends a message intended for Group/A, the WebSocket server forwards it to the message service.</li>
                  <li>The message service handles the initial processing and routing of the message.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Message Service Sends the Message to Kafka:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The message service packages the message with metadata such as group ID (Group/A), sender ID, and timestamp.</li>
                  <li>The service publishes the message to Kafka for further processing.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Kafka's Responsibility (Message Broker):</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Topic Management:</b> Kafka treats each group (e.g., Group/A) as a "topic." Topics are logical channels for organizing messages, where producers (senders) write messages and consumers (receivers) read them.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Message Storage:</b> Kafka temporarily stores the message in a partitioned log associated with the Group/A topic, ensuring durability even during failures or delays.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Scalability:</b> Kafka partitions topics for parallel processing, enabling the handling of millions of messages efficiently.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Producer and Consumer Decoupling:</b> Kafka decouples senders (producers) and receivers (consumers), simplifying the architecture and allowing dynamic scaling of recipients.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Consumer Coordination:</b> Kafka ensures that all intended recipients receive messages in the correct order, coordinating delivery between producers and consumers.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Group Service Retrieves Group Metadata:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The group service maintains metadata for groups, including:
                    <ul>
                      <li>User IDs in the group.</li>
                      <li>Group ID and status (active/inactive).</li>
                      <li>Group attributes like the group icon and number of members.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Metadata is stored in a MySQL database cluster with:
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Secondary Replicas:</b> Geographically distributed replicas ensure high availability and reduce latency for read operations.</li>
                      <li><b>Redis Cache:</b> Frequently accessed group data is cached to improve response times and reduce database load.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Group Message Handler Fetches Group Data:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve Group/A user data and statuses (online/offline).</li>
                  <li>It retrieves the message for Group/A from Kafka and processes it.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Message Delivery to Group Members:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The group message handler acts as the consumer for Kafka messages.</li>
                  <li>For each user in Group/A:
                    <ul>
                      <li>If the user is online, the handler forwards the message to the WebSocket server they are connected to for real-time delivery.</li>
                      <li>If the user is offline, the message may be stored temporarily or forwarded to a push notification system.</li>
