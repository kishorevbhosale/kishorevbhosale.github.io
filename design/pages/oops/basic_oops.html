    <hr>
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that models software using real-world objects. These objects interact with one another to solve complex problems. OOP focuses on objects as the central component, allowing for better modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code.</p>

    <!-- Attributes -->
    <div>
        <h4>1. Attributes</h4>
        <p>Attributes are the data or properties that define the state of an object. They are stored in variables within a class. Each object can have different values for these attributes.</p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <div class="example">
            <p>If you have a class "Car", its attributes could be "color", "make", "model", and "year". Every individual car object (instance of the class) will have these attributes with specific values.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Methods -->
    <div>
        <h4>2. Methods</h4>
        <p>Methods are functions defined within a class that represent the behaviors or actions that objects of the class can perform. They operate on the object's attributes and may return values or perform specific tasks.</p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <div class="example">
            <p>In a "Car" class, methods could include "startEngine()", "accelerate()", or "brake()". These methods define how the car behaves when certain actions are triggered.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Classes -->
    <div>
        <h4>3. Classes</h4>
        <p>A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that its objects will have. Each object created from a class is an instance of that class.</p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <div class="example">
            <p>A "Car" class defines the general characteristics and behaviors of a car. Each specific car, such as "myCar" or "yourCar", is an object created from this class with its own attributes (color, make, model, etc.) and behaviors (startEngine, accelerate, etc.).</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Objects -->
    <div>
        <h4>4. Objects</h4>
        <p>An object is an instance of a class, which contains specific values for its attributes and the ability to perform methods. Objects are the real-world entities that we interact with in an OOP program.</p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <div class="example">
            <p>If "Car" is a class, "myCar" is an object of that class. It has specific values for attributes like "color" and "make" and can perform methods like "startEngine()" or "accelerate()".</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="section-title">The Four Principles of Object-Oriented Programming</h3>

    
    <div>
        <h4>1. Data hiding</h4>
        <p>Data hiding is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the practice of restricting access to the internal state (attributes) of an object and allowing access only through well-defined interfaces (methods). This ensures data integrity by preventing unauthorized or accidental modifications.</p>
        <p>The two key components of data hiding are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encapsulation</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Abstraction</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Encapsulation -->
    <div>
        <h4>2. Encapsulation</h4>
        <p>Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and provides controlled access through methods such as getters and setters.</p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <div class="example">   
            <p>In a "BankAccount" class, the balance attribute might be private and only accessible via methods like "deposit()" or "withdraw()". This ensures the balance can't be directly modified without control.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Abstraction -->
    <div>
        <h4>3. Abstraction</h4>
        <p>Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It simplifies interaction with the object by only showing the necessary methods and attributes.</p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <div class="example">
            <p>When you drive a car, you only interact with the steering wheel and pedals without worrying about the complex mechanics of the engine. The "drive()" method abstracts away these details.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Inheritance -->
    <div>
        <h4>4. Inheritance</h4>
        <p>Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (child or subclass) inherits the properties and methods of another class (parent or superclass). This allows the child class to reuse the code from the parent class and add or override functionality as needed.</p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <div class="example">
            <p>A "Vehicle" class could define common properties like "speed" and methods like "accelerate()". A "Car" class can inherit from "Vehicle" and add specific features such as "startRadio()" without redefining the common features.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Polymorphism -->
    <div>
        <h4>5. Polymorphism</h4>
        <p>Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means a single method or function can work in different ways depending on the object it is acting upon.</p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <div class="example">
            <p>A "draw()" method can behave differently for different shapes like "Circle" and "Rectangle". Both are shapes, but the method is implemented differently in each class, giving them unique behaviors while sharing the same interface.</p>
